        Thanks to artificial intelligence techniques, the evaluation of student schedules
        can be done automatically in a simple and fast way to show AUM students recommendations
        tailored to their interests and preferences.


        So how does this application work? First, we need to collect data from previous
        semesters: what courses the students enrolled in, what day and time their
        classes were, what was the student''s major and type of courses (optional,
        compulsory, with prerequisites), and whether students were satisfied with
        their schedule and the number of courses they passed. Then we need to store
        all these data, clean and analyze them. The application will then evaluate
        the student''s current prospective schedule and rate it (ie: easy, hard, very
        hard, etc.).


        In this project, we focus on students'' historical data to help them in their
        decision-making processes regarding their academic schedules.


        Apply machine and deep learning methods to accurately evaluate the student''s
        prospective schedules and rate them'}
